new:
using singular value decompoistion(SVD) to sovle E phi psi,
then E X Y

replace pfaffian by pfaffianXun method


bugs:
(1.fixed)the energy \omega/J missing a factor of 2
(2)in some extrem parameter case, e.g. g=0, lambda1=1, lambda2=0, the result is unphysical,
need somesmall breaking symmetry, g=0.00001;
or this is only because the S(w,k) scattering signal is almost zero, except for filted delta peak at origin(mag-order)




how to use this program:
run.m should be compiled, 
then the (x.something) in input.mat is the input,
input.mat is generated by construct_input.m
the outputs are output.m, and 2 png graphs


future developments:
modify B2 B4 to simpler version, phi psi to replace X Y formalism.
so that, <ZZ> and <ZZZZ> can be easily constructed
